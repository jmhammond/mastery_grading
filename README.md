# Grading Generator

## What it does:
Given a comma-separated spreadsheet downloaded from Blackboard, it reads the marks on each learning target, converts it to a point total, and counts the number of marks under proficient; For information about how the proficiency/mastery marks are converted into "points", please review your syllabus which is linked on Blackboard.

It then generates a PDF summary for each student, with the file named after the student. 


Keep in mind that I'm a math teacher and not a programmer (I bailed on that job over a decade ago!)
