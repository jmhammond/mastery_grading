# Grading Generator

## What it does:
Given a comma-separated spreadsheet downloaded from Blackboard, it reads the last two marks on each standard, converts it to a point total, and counts the number of marks under G;
It then generates a PDF summary for each student, with the file named after the student. 

This repository has dummy data (test.csv) test purposes.

## For the midterm grade: 

| Midterm Letter Grade | Course Standards                          | WebAssign Homework (12.1-12.4 Chapter 6, Chapter 7, 8.1, 8.2) |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| A                    | ≥ 19 points and no scores below G         | ≥ 80%                                                         |
| B                    | ≥ 17 points and at most 2 scores below G  | ≥ 70%                                                         |
| C                    | ≥ 13 points and at most 4 scores below G  | ≥ 60%                                                         |
| D                    | ≥ 11 points                               | ≥ 50%                                                         |
| F                    | < 11 points                               | < 50%                                                         |

## Background
From the syllabus:
We will use a Mastery Grading Approach in this course, instead of the traditional percentage-based system you’ve seen before. It is my hope that this style of assessment will give you a clearer picture on the expectations of our course, how well you have mastered the course material, and how you can improve your understanding (and your grade!).

The two key ideas of Mastery Grading are:
You will not receive partial credit for partially correct answers; but
You will be given many opportunities to improve your scores.

When you turn in the solution to a problem, I will map your solution to an associated standard. Each standard is a statement describing some mathematical idea, skill, or task. Our course standards are grouped by the Big Questions and each standard provides part of the answer to one of these questions. When I look at your solutions, you will earn one of the following letter grades on any associated standard: S, G, or N. If you are unhappy with your score, you will be given the opportunity to try again. 

The SGN Rubric

| Grade            | What it means                                                                                                                                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Successful       | The solution to the problem is complete and clear. Any error is trivial. The solution is correct, legible, easy to follow, and all reasoning is provided.  (1 point) |
| Growing          | The solution shows growth toward mastering a topic, however it is incomplete, incorrect, or needs revision.  (½  point)                                              |
| Not assessable   | No response provided, or the solution was attempted using an inappropriate methodology for the problem type. (0 points)                                              |


I will keep track of your points earned on the two most recent attempts for each standard, meaning that your scores might go up or down over time. This system rewards your continued mastery of the material. A particular standard might appear several times throughout the semester (for example, on a quiz and again on a midterm exam) and your score will be updated each time. A copy of our Course Standards will be posted to Blackboard.
