        This is the grade based on the SGN grading system. We consider the last two attempts on each standard. The letter 'S' is worth 1 point, the letter 'G' is worth 0.5 points, and the letter 'N' is worth 0 points.

    </p>
    <p>
        The 'NaN' that you see is 'not a number'(*) and means we haven't attempted that standard yet. If you see a 'Z' that means that there was no work for that standard.
