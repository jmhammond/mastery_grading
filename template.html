                How was this computed?
            </h3>

            <p>
                This is the grade based on the SGN grading system. We consider only the last two attempts on each standard (rightmost-letters). The letter 'S' is worth 1 point, the letter 'G' is worth 0.5 points, and the letter 'N' is worth 0 points. If you see a 'Z' that means that there was no work for that standard.
            </p>
            <p>
                The calculation of the letter grade is determined by thresholds outlined in the syllabus and below. Additionally, the +/- is determined by proximity to the next letter grade. Note that this document gives only the letter grade. +/- is assigned on MyWSU.
            </p>

            <h3>How was it computed? As in the code?</h3>
            <p class="message">I've generated this report via python pandas, acting off the raw dataset from Blackboard's gradebook. You can check <a href="https://github.com/jmhammond/mastery_grading">my code on GitHub</a>.
